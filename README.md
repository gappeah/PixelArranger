# Pixel Arranger

1. Define the Scope of the Project:

    Project Objective: Clearly define the purpose of the image sorter.
    Target Platform: Decide if the project will run locally or as a web application.
    User Interface: Plan if you need a user interface to input images or if the process will be command-line driven.

2. Python Libraries:

    OpenCV or Pillow: These libraries can read and process image files in Python.
    Numpy: Useful for array manipulation and calculations.
    Matplotlib or Seaborn: Optional for visualizing image data.
    Any GUI Toolkit (if required): Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy for a graphical user interface.

3. Understanding Image Processing:

    Image Loading: Learn how to load images into your Python program using OpenCV or Pillow.
    Color Spaces: Understand color spaces, particularly the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) or HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) for analyzing and sorting based on hue.

4. Algorithm Development:

    Image Analysis: Develop an algorithm to extract the hue information from images.
    Sorting Logic: Create logic to sort images based on their hue values.
    Grouping: Decide how you want to group the images after sorting (e.g., creating folders or displaying them together).

5. User Interaction (if applicable):

    Input Method: Plan how users will input images (file upload, folder selection, etc.).
    Output Display: Decide how the sorted images will be displayed or saved.

6. Testing and Optimization:

    Unit Testing: Test individual components to ensure they work as expected.
    Performance Testing: Check for performance bottlenecks in case of large image sets.
    Optimization: Optimize code for better performance if needed.

7. Documentation and Packaging:

    Code Documentation: Document your code to make it understandable for others.
    Packaging: Create a distributable package if you plan to share the application with others.

Getting Started:

    Setting Up Environment: Install required Python libraries (OpenCV/Pillow, Numpy, etc.) using pip or Conda.
    Code Structure: Start by setting up the basic structure of your Python project.
    Sample Code: Write code snippets to load an image, extract hue information, and display or save sorted images.
